# Salesforce REST API Framework

[![Salesforce CI (Ant migration tool)](https://github.com/lciesielski/REST-API-Framework/actions/workflows/ant.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/lciesielski/REST-API-Framework/actions/workflows/ant.yml)

## Use Case

Basically, every client is running multiple apps\CRM Instances\environments, and thus sooner or later you will have to implement some form of integration.
In Salesforce the are two types of API, standard one provided natively by SF, and custom one that you have to implement from scratch.
While standard version is quite powerful, it might be the case when you will find its capabilities to simply be not enough.
I found out that while Salesforce trigger handlers do get much love in the terms of open source examples, REST integration frameworks are a little behind, so I decided to throw my two cents.
